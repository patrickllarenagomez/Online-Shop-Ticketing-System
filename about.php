      About EZPrinter

EZPrinter is the premier mobile printing solution that enables users to securely print from any smartphone, tablet, laptop or desktop, to any printer, no matter the networks in between. With EZPrinter you can “Print Simply Anywhere®”.
</p>
<p class="text-left">
Today EZPrinter has the broadest and deepest secure mobile print offering available for cloud or on premise deployment. This is a direct result of cumulative product innovation and evolution since 2001 when EZPrinter pioneered secure mobile printing. Now a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics (since 2014), EZPrinter has both the strength and wherewithal of a global technology leader and the agility of a smaller independent company to advance the state of secure printing, tracking, and management. This unique combination enables EZPrinter to continue to both innovate and support its customer base around the world. Today EZPrinter is deployed in over 100 countries and has printed well over 100 million pages.
